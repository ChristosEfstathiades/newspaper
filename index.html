        <h3>Moon Landing is a success</h3>
        <p>The highly anticipated moon landing is a success that the soviets will never forget. We fought long and hard in order to achieve this but it all paid off when astronaut Neil Armstrong planted the American flag. This is perhaps the greatest achievment of the 20th century and to a lot of people this is the American dream.</P>

        <p>After the Soviets beat us to space in 1957 when they launched sputnik things weren't looking good for us and when they got Yuri Gagarin to space in 1961 we were not sure we could pull this off however we pulled through and bounced back with force and stomped on those reds.</p>

        <h3>"The Eagle has landed."</h3>
        <p>Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first two men to walk on the moon and Michael Collins flew the command module <i>Columbia</i> in orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin were on the surface of the moon, Armstrong said "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." Truly inspirational to all.</p>
